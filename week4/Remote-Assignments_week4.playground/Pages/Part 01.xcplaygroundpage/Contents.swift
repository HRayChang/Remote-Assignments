    2. There are several methods defined in the UITableViewDataSource protocol. Which methods are called by the system after we manually call reloadData() of a table view and what are their sequences? Please describe in as much detail as possible.
     
    Ans:
 
        Calling the reloadData() method will reload all the data used to construct the table. This includes cells, section headers and footers, index arrays, and more.

            1. cellForRowAtIndexPath: This method is used to get the cells for all the rows and sections.
            2. numberOfSections: Use this method to determine the number of sections in the table view.
            3. numberOfRowsInSection: Use this method to determine the number of rows in each section.
            4. cellForRowAt: This method is used to configure and return a cell.
